## Introduction

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.
- The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate humamn language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually relevant.
- NLP invovles a variety of tasks and challenges, ranging from basic tasks like language translation and sentiment analysis to more complex tasks like natural language understanding and generation.
